# ZeroTrace

> **Share sensitive information securely — it vanishes after being read.**

ZeroTrace is a **MERN stack web application** built as a learning-focused project to explore **secure secret sharing, encryption, and full-stack development**.

The idea is simple but powerful: you create a secret (password, API key, or private message), share a unique link, and **once it’s viewed, it’s permanently deleted** from the database. 

No history.
No recovery.
No trace. 🕶️

## 🚀 Features

- **Create Secrets**  
  Generate a unique, one-time link for sensitive information.
- **One-Time View (Self-Destruct)**  
  The secret is destroyed immediately after being accessed.
- **Encrypted Storage**  
  Secrets are encrypted using **AES encryption**, ensuring even database admins cannot read them.
- **Secure by Design**  
  Helmet, CORS, rate limiting, validation, and secure cookies are implemented.
- **Responsive UI**  
  Fully mobile-friendly interface built with Tailwind CSS.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd ZeroTrace
```

### 2️⃣ Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file inside the backend folder (or copy from `.env.example`):
```env
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongo_uri
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_encryption_key
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_admin_password
```
*Note: `ENCRYPTION_KEY` must be exactly 32 characters long.*

Start the backend server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Server runs at: `http://localhost:5000`

### 3️⃣ Frontend Setup
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
Open in browser: `http://localhost:5173`
